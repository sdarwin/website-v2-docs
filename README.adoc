== Antora

 https://antora.org/[Antora] is a static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc content.
The tool renders the documentation for Boost modules whose documentation are defined as components in the Antora playbook.

== Installing Antora

=== Dependencies

Antora requires https://nodejs.org[Node.js,window=_blank]:

[source,bash]
----
$ node -v
----

This command should return the Node.js version number:

[source,console]
----
v16.18.0
----

Antora requires Node.js version 16 or later.
If you have Node.js installed but need to upgrade it:

[source,bash]
----
$ nvm install --lts
----

The following instructions also require https://git-scm.com/[Git,window=_blank] to clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git --version
----

This command should return the Git version number:

[source,console]
----
git version 2.25.1
----

=== Cloning the repository

To clone the repository that defines the Antora playbook for the Boost documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://www.github.com/boostorg/website-v2-docs
----

This command clones the repository into a directory named `website-v2-docs`.
This directory contains the Antora playbook files `site.playbook.yml` (website documentation) and `libs.playbook.yml` (library documentation).

[[running-antora]]
=== Running Antora

After cloning the project, you need to install its dependencies using the Node.js package manager, npm:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm ci
----

Then build the Antora UI bundle used for the documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd antora-ui
$ npx gulp
$ cd ..
----

The `npx` command, which comes with npm, can be used to build any of the playbooks in the repository.

[source,bash]
----
$ npx antora --fetch libs.playbook.yml
----

Or to build the website documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ npx antora --fetch site.playbook.yml
----

This commands will build the documentation in the `build/` directory.

`npx` will download the Antora CLI and the Antora site generator, and then run the `antora` command with the specified playbook.
These dependencies are cached locally, so the next time you run `npx antora`, it will be faster.

In the release process, Antora is called with extra attributes used by the documentation components.
For instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ npx antora --fetch --attribute page-boost-branch=master --attribute page-boost-ui-branch=master --attribute page-commit-id=151c2ac libs.playbook.yml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Instead of using the Antora versioning control system, we render the documentation for a single version by setting `version: ~` in the `antora.yml` file.
The `--attribute` options let us render the playbook for a single documentation version with context about the current version.
====

The `libdoc.sh` script simplifies the process by building the UI bundle, identifying these attributes, and running the Antora command with the specified playbook.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./libdoc.sh master
----

Or to build the website documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./sitedoc.sh master
----

[source,console]
----
Site generation complete!
Open file:///home/user/path/to/antora/build/master/doc in a browser to view your site.
Site generation complete!
Open file:///home/user/path/to/antora/build/doc in a browser to view your site.
----

The `build.sh` script identifies the branch of the current repository and runs the `sitedoc.sh` script with the branch name as an argument:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./build.sh
----

Although not necessary, you also have the option of installing Antora globally so that the antora command is available on your `PATH`.

[source,bash]
----
$ npm i -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator
----

[source,bash]
----
$ antora -v
----

Read more about antora on their https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/[Quickstart guide,window=_blank].

== Playbook Components

The website is composed of components defined in the `content.sources` field of its playbook file
`site.playbook.yml`.
All components of the website are relative to the website-v2-docs repository.

The process for generating the documentation for all libraries is similar.
However, the components are defined in the `libs.playbook.yml` file and their URLs are relative to the `boostorg` organization.
Each library documentation is defined as a component in the playbook file `libs.playbook.yml`:

[source,yml]
----
content:
  sources:
    - url: https://github.com/boostorg/url
      start_path: doc
  # ...
----

The complete `libdoc.sh` command syntax is:

[source,console]
----
Usage: ./libdoc.sh { branch | version | 'release' | 'all' }...

    branch : 'develop' | 'master' | 'release'
    version: [0-9]+ '.' [0-9]+ '.' [0-9]+
    'release': builds master to build/doc/html
    'all': rebuilds develop, master, and every version

Examples:

    ./libdoc.sh develop master      # build develop and master
    ./libdoc.sh 1.83.0              # build tagged version boost-1.83.0
----

The first positional argument is the only parameter, which identifies which version should be built.

* `branch`: valid arguments are `master` or `develop`.
Builds the `master` or `develop` versions of the documentation in `build/master/libs` or `build/develop/libs`.
It checks out all libraries in their `master` or `develop` branches.
* `version`: a semver version, such as `1.82.0` describing a Boost version.
This allows us to generate the documentation content of an old Boost version with the current version of the Antora UI.
* `'release'`: generate the `master` version to `build/doc/html` with the `release` UI layout.
This layout omits the header, Google analytics, and Edit this Page.
This version of the documentation is meant to be distributed with sources files in the Boost release.
* `'all'`: retroactively iterate and generate the documentation for all versions of Boost
with the most recent Antora UI. This command iterates each playbook in the `history` directory.

The master/develop branches of the library documentation are designed to co-exist alongside the per-release documentation and thus the branch name (or release version) does appear in its URLs.

== Component Layout

Each Antora-enabled library includes the https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/organize-content-files/[component version descriptor file] `doc/antora.yml`.
Each library should contain an `antora.yml` describing the component.
For instance,

[source,yml]
----
name: mp11
title: Boost.Mp11
version: ~
nav:
  - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
----

After defining the `doc/antora.yml` file, the source files should be organized in the `modules` directory.
Typically, `doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` is the main navigation file for the library documentation and `doc/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc` is the main page.
You can find more information about the https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/component-version-descriptor/[Component Version Descriptor,window=_blank] and https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/[Pages,window=_blank] in the Antora documentation.

Once these files are in place, the library can be registered as a component in the `libs.playbook.yml` file with a Pull Request to the `website-v2-docs` repository:

[source,yml]
----
content:
  sources:
  # ...
    - <library-name>: https://github.com/boostorg/<library-name>
      start_path: doc
----

== Local playbooks

When working locally on an individual component, it's usually desirable to create a local playbook for your project so that you can render the documentation locally for a single component.
The local playbook is a copy of the main playbook that removes all components except the one you are working on.

For instance, you can create a copy of `libs.playbook.yml` as `doc/local-playbook.yml`, remove all components except the one you are working on, and adjust the component URL to point to your local filesystem:

[source,yml]
----
# ...
content:
  sources:
    - url: ..
      start_path: doc
      edit_url: 'https://github.com/boostorg/<library-name>/edit/{refname}/{path}'
# ...
----

This way, you can render the documentation locally for your component without having to render the entire Boost documentation:

[source,bash]
----
$ npx antora --fetch local-playbook.yml
----

When writing a Boost library proposal, include your library in this local playbook.

== Antora Extensions

// Antora provides an event-based extension facility you can tap into to augment or influence the functionality of the generator

Antora supports https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/extend/extensions/[extensions,window=_blank] that can be used to augment the functionality of the generator.
The playbooks in the `website-v2-docs` repository include a number of extensions that are available to all components.

=== {cpp} Tagfiles Extension

The https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cppalliance/antora-cpp-tagfiles-extension[@cppalliance/antora-cpp-tagfiles-extension,window=_blank] extension allows components to include links to {cpp} symbols defined in the library or external libraries.

For instance, `cpp:std::string[]` will generate a link to the `std::string` symbol in the documentation.
Note that after the `cpp:` prefix from custom inline macros, the syntax is similar to the one used to generate regular links in AsciiDoc, where the link is replaced by the symbol name.

The link for each symbol is generated from a tagfile provided by the main playbook or by the extension.
The playbook can define tagfiles for other libraries by including the `cpp-tagfiles` field in the extension configuration:

[source,yml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    # ...
    - require: '@cppalliance/antora-cpp-tagfiles-extension'
      cpp-tagfiles:
        files:
          - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-url-doxygen.tag.xml
            base_url: 'xref:reference:'
          - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-system-doxygen.tag.xml
            base_url: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/system/doc/html/
        using-namespaces:
          - 'boost::'
    # ...
----

Note that the `files` field is a list of tagfiles that are used to generate links to symbols in the documentation.
These tagfiles can be generated by other tools like Doxygen or MrDocs.
In some cases, users might want to write their own tagfiles to include symbols from other libraries.
As tagfiles only describe relative links to symbols, the `base_url` field is used to generate the full URL to the symbol.

Also note the `using-namespaces` field, which is a list of namespaces that are used to generate links to symbols in the documentation.
In the example above, `cpp:small_vector[]` will generate a link to the `boost::small_vector` symbol in the documentation unless there's a tagfile that defines a symbol with the same name in the global namespace.

Each component can also define its own tagfiles by including the `cpp-tagfiles` field in the component descriptor file:

[source,yml]
----
ext:
  cpp-tagfiles:
      files:
        - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-url-doxygen.tag.xml
          base_url: 'xref:reference:'
        - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-system-doxygen.tag.xml
          base_url: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/system/doc/html/
        - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-core-doxygen.tag.xml
          base_url: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/core/doc/html/
        - file: ./doc/tagfiles/boost-filesystem-doxygen.tag.xml
          base_url: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/filesystem/doc/
      using-namespaces:
        - boost::urls
        - boost::urls::grammar
        - boost::system
        - boost::core
----

Files and namespaces defined in components are only applied to that component.

More information about the extension can be found in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-cpp-tagfiles-extension[its repository,window=_blank] and issues should be reported in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-cpp-tagfiles-extension/issues[its issue tracker,window=_blank].

=== {cpp} Reference Extension

The https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cppalliance/antora-cpp-reference-extension[@cppalliance/antora-cpp-reference-extension,window=_blank] extension generates reference documentation for {cpp} symbols in your codebase and creates an Antora module with its pages.
The asciidoc documentation pages are generated with MrDocs and populated in the `reference` Antora module.

This means, the generated reference pages can be linked in your `doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` file as:

[source,adoc]
----
// ...
* Reference
** xref:reference:index.adoc[]
// ...
----

To enable the extension for your component, include the extension configuration in the `antora.yml` file:

[source,yml]
----
# ...
ext:
  cpp-reference:
    config: doc/mrdocs.yml
# ...
----

The `mrdocs.yml` file will typically include parameters to generate a `compile_commands.json` file used to generate the reference documentation.
For more information about MrDocs and configuration files, see https://www.mrdocs.com/docs[window=_blank].

The process to generate `compile_commands.json` typically depends on third-party libraries used to compile the project.
In the case of Boost libraries, other Boost libraries should be available to the command that generates the `compile_commands.json` file.
The dependencies available to components are defined in the `libs.playbook.yml` file.

[source,yml]
----
antora:
  extensions:
    - require: '@cppalliance/antora-cpp-reference-extension'
      dependencies:
        - name: 'boost'
          repo: 'https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git'
          tag: 'develop'
          variable: 'BOOST_SRC_DIR'
          system-env: 'BOOST_SRC_DIR'
----

The extension will download each dependency defined in this list and expose it to the MrDocs environment via the environment variable defined in `variable`.
If the library is already available in the system, the `system-env` field can be used to expose it to Antora, so it uses this existing path instead of downloading the library.

More information about the extension can be found in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-cpp-reference-extension[its repository,window=_blank] and issues should be reported in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-cpp-reference-extension/issues[its issue tracker,window=_blank].

=== Boost Links Extension

The https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cppalliance/asciidoctor-boost-links[@cppalliance/asciidoctor-boost-links,window=_blank] extension allows component pages to include links to Boost libraries and tools.
For instance:

[source,asciidoc]
----
boost:core[]
----

This will render as if the equivalent AsciiDoc code was used:

[source,asciidoc]
----
https://www.boost.org/libs/core[Boost.Core]
----

When processed by Asciidoc, this renders as "https://www.boost.org/libs/core[Boost.Core]":

[source,html]
----
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/core">Boost.Core</a>
----

The extension supports Boost libraries and tools.
When no custom text is provided, the extension will use the library name in `PascalCase` as the link text.
When a Boost author has a preference for a different default link text, these are implemented directly in the extension.

More information about the extension can be found in https://github.com/cppalliance/asciidoctor-boost-links[its repository,window=_blank] and issues should be reported in https://github.com/cppalliance/asciidoctor-boost-links/issues[its issue tracker,window=_blank].

=== Playbook Macros Extension

The https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cppalliance/antora-playbook-macros-extension[@cppalliance/antora-playbook-macros-extension,window=_blank] extension allows playbooks to include macros that can be used to generate content in the playbook.
Each macro has a default value that can be overridden with environment variables, the Antora `--attribute` command line option, or directly in the playbook with the `asciidoc.attributes` field.

The macro is used to implement the branch functionality described in section <<running-antora>>.
More information about the extension can be found in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-playbook-macros-extension[its repository,window=_blank] and issues should be reported in https://github.com/cppalliance/antora-playbook-macros-extension/issues[its issue tracker,window=_blank].

== Antora UI Bundle

Each Antora playbook includes a UI bundle that defines the layout of the documentation.

[source,yaml]
----
ui:
  bundle:
    url: ./antora-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
----

This provides a consistent layout across all components of the playbook.

The source code for the UI bundle is located in the `antora-ui` directory of the repository.

The bundle includes a few options to customize the Boost UI by setting the following options in the main playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    # Enable pagination
    page-pagination: ''
    # Remove the sidenav and include TOC in index.adoc page
    remove-sidenav: ''
    # Include the contents panel with the TOC for the current page
    page-toc: ''
----

By default, all options are disabled.
Setting the options to any string (including the empty string) enables it.
This is a convention used by Antora to enable/disable options in bundles.

The settings defined in the playbook apply to all documentation components.

The UI bundle documentation is available in the `antora-ui/README.adoc` file. This file describes the structure of the UI bundle and how to customize it.
